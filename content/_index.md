👋 I am Avijit, a M.S. + Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), India and a member of the [CVIT lab](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/), jointly advised by [C. V. Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/), IIIT Hyderabad, and [Karteek Alahari](https://thoth.inrialpes.fr/people/alahari/) at the [Thoth group](https://team.inria.fr/thoth/), Inria. My primary research focuses on egocentric video understanding, driven by a long-term vision to make assistive technologies universally accessible. In the past, I have interned at [Adobe Research India](https://research.adobe.com/), and been a visiting scientist at [Thoth, Inria](https://team.inria.fr/thoth/). One of my works was featured on [Meta's YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/TTVoW289UoU).

My Ph.D. is funded by the [Google India Ph.D. Fellowship, 2017](https://research.google/programs-and-events/phd-fellowship/recipients/?filtertab=2017) (1 out of 4 recipients). Thank you Google!
